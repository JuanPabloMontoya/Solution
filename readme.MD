# Invoice ETL Pipeline

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for invoice processing. The pipeline extracts invoice data using the Veryfi API, transforms the OCR output into a structured JSON format, and finally loads the processed data into a results folder. The project is modularized into separate components (extraction, transformation, and loading) to improve maintainability and scalability.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

First, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, then create and activate a virtual environment:

- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install Requirements
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Pipeline

IMPORTANT: Enter your credentials in the file src/static/credentials.json

To run the invoice processing pipeline, simply execute:

bash

python main.py

This command will process all PDF files in the Documents folder, save the Veryfi JSON outputs in the veryfi_jsons folder, and write the transformed invoice data to the results folder.

Running the Unit Tests
To verify the integrity of the transformation process, run the unit tests with:

bash

python -m unittest discover -s tests
This command will automatically discover and execute all tests located in the tests folder.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:


project/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── extract.py
│   ├── transform.py
│   ├── load.py
│   └── static/
│       └── credentials.json
├── veryfi_jsons/         # JSON files generated by the Veryfi API
├── results/              # Processed JSON files
└── tests/
    └── test_results.py   # Unit tests for validation
This structure allows for clear separation of concerns and easy maintenance.
